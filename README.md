# SQRT_Approximation_With_Any_SQR
an approximation of sqrt
it uses the cdis and some /2 *2 and /10 
but it works 

it replaces the Boxes Like Approximation System 
it works like the weirdo function 
it can replace weirdo and be used in conjuction with 
the bee function 
to show the result set

so its a hack for a high cpu intensive chain-division task / process

as long as work in the cases or range of number it works
